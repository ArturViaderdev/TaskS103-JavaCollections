# Task S103 - Java Collections

## Level 1

### Exercise 1

In this exercise I tested the use of ArrayList and HashSet.
ArrayList allows duplicates, hashset not allows duplicates.
ArrayList has a position for each element, hashset not haves a position for the elements.

I implemented equals in the class of data stored because it makes the name of the month cannot be repeated.
If not I could be repeated because the repeated month is another instance of the class.

I explored the hashset with for each and with iterator.
