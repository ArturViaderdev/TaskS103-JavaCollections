# Task S103 - Java Collections

## Level 1

### Exercise 1

In this exercise I tested the use of ArrayList and HashSet.
ArrayList allows duplicates, hashset not allows duplicates.
ArrayList has a position for each element, hashset not haves a position for the elements.

I implemented equals in the class of data stored because it makes the name of the month cannot be repeated.
If not it could be repeated because the repeated month is another instance of the class.

I explored the hashset with for each and with iterator.

### Exercise 2

I create two integer lists and fill it with numbers. Later I add the contents from the first list to the second list using a listiterator.
The List allows to have repeated numbers, and it maintains the order.
